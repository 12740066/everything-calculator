      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Skins:</strong> Each hole is worth a set monetary value (Skin Value). The player with the lowest stroke count wins the skin for that hole.</li>
        <li><strong>Handicap Compensation:</strong> Adjusted scores are calculated based on player handicaps.</li>
        <li><strong>Bonus and Penalty:</strong> Players can earn bonuses (e.g., birdies, eagles) or incur penalties (e.g., extra strokes).</li>
        <li><strong>Eagle and Albatross Rates:</strong> Special rates apply for eagles and albatrosses, which affect earnings calculations.</li>
        <li><strong>NTP (Nearest To Pin):</strong> On par-3 holes, the player nearest to the pin wins bonus skins.</li>
        <li><strong>Long Drive:</strong> On par-5 holes, the player with the longest drive (on the fairway) wins bonus skins.</li>
        <li><strong>Carryovers:</strong> If no player wins a hole outright, the skins carry over to the next hole.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Progress:</strong> You can save your game progress and load it later.</li>
      </ol>
